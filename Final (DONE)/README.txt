A humble plea:

If at all possible, I think I shoud recieve partial credit for homeworks 13 and 15 with the submission of this, my final project. My reasoning is that I have ddemonstrated
the ability to implement several features covered in those assignments (for 13 and 14) in my final, and, while I do not have time to submit them individually, I certainly would if I had a
few more days. Of course, there are finite limits to this semester's length, but, given that I started so late this semester, and have thus far accomplished a passing (and often
substantially more than) score on previoous assignments. I should be clear that I am not expecting to pass this course with
flying colors, given my unique constraints, but, I am concerned as to whether I may pass at all with those two assignments missing.

In the case of homework 13, I have completed the following rubric requirements:
- Add 5 3D textured objects/models to the screens. Use different textures for each object.
- All shapes should rotate around the model at different speeds.
- All simple shapes (box, cone, cylinder, etc.) should be held and displayed from an array
- Add your name and title to the piece.

In the case of homework 15, I have extensively documented the making of this project in notes throughout the code.

*Again, I'm not asking for full marks, just something that isn't zero*

I therefore request that I should be granted such relief, that my efforts and demonstrated understanding of class topics be not in vain.

P.S.
No hard feelings if you can't do it
