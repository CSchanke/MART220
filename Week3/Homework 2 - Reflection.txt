I was a little taken aback at exactly how quickly ChatGPT was able to fulfill this request. It took less than a minute! Mind you, it wasn't very specific. I asked for random sized shapes and colors, and what I got was random shapes, sizes, colors, and locations. Now, it would be very easy to modify that, but I was once told that, in programming, you ought to give the customer EXACTLY what they ask for. Maybe that's an outdated perspective, or maybe it's a really pedantic complaint to have here considering the end result was close enough to what I asked for, but it's something to be wary of in the future. Ultimately, as far as quality is concerned, I don't feel that ChatGPT really did anything groundbreaking here, I mean, this is dead simple stuff, but it didnâ€™t really do anything I wouldn't -- although it did it in a minute instead of an hour.
