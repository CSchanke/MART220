I generated all three images using ChatGPT. I originally only generated the sushi, but then I realized it would be easier to ask ChatGPT for images of a specific size and style
rather than hunt for pictures I wanted and then resize them in paint. As for the images themselves, I'm very satisfied. Unlike that first burger image, they all seem just fine.
In fact, ChatGPT draws a better cartoon owl than I ever could, and a lot faster.

As a sidenote, I finally got Visual Studio working, so hopefully these assignments will be easier from here on out. Until now, I've been writing them in notepad or the
p5.js web editor and then copying everything over to text files to upload to GitHub, which was a pain.
